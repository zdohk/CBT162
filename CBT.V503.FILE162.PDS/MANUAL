0     Many large programming systems are constructed from a large number of sepa
      rately assembled or compiled sections.    Such systems must manage interna
      communications by means of a set of  vector tables and other control block
      that are known to each of the separate sections; which is to say, such con
      trol blocks  must contain fields that  may be referenced and/or  changed b
      any or all of the sections.  Accordingly, a global cross-reference listing
      reporting which sections reference which fields,  is a very useful tool fo
      a large-systems developer to have.
0        XREFASM is a relatively simple system  that generates such global cross
      reference listings.   Specifically,   XREFASM generates a report  showing
      sorted list  of all labels  used in a given  set of separate  assemblies o
      compilations.   The entries  for each label show both  which assemblies (o
      compilations)  reference that  label and how many  references each assembl
      has to that label.  Figure 1 shows a sample XREFASM output.

      grams assembled or compiled by the following processors:

0        ® IBM's Assembler-H Version 2, with or without the "S.L.A.C." mods.

0     XREFIN accumulates cross-reference data from  individual assemblies or com
      pilations.  It is designed to be used as follows:
0        ® One-step assembly jobs  should be changed to  two-step jobs consistin
           of the assembly step followed by the XREFIN step.
0        ® The assembly step should write its listing file to a temporary datase
           rather than to spool.
0        ® The XREFIN step can then read the listing file and extract from it th
           relevant cross-reference information.  In addition, the XREFIN progra
           can echo the listing dataset to a SYSPRINT file, if desired.
0        XREFIN extracts cross-reference data and writes it "mod" to an accumula
      tion dataset which will later be processed by XREFOUT.  Each record writte
      is assigned both the  name of the current assembly and  a timestamp associ
      ated with the  current run.   XREFIN infers the assembly  name by examinin
      the page  title lines appearing in  the assembly listing.   The  first wor
      appearing in the title line is taken to be the assembly name.  For both th
      S/370 Assembler, Assembler H,  and the Series/1 Assembler,  this first wor
      is set from the name field of the "TITLE" assembler statement.
0        The timestamp is stored so that later XREFOUT can control the results o
      repeated assemblies of the same sections.  If the same section is assemble
      twice and XREFIN is, therefore,  executed twice for the same section,  the
      two complete sets of cross-reference data  will be written to the accumula
      tion file.   Because of the timestamps, XREFOUT can recognize the situatio
      and discard the older cross-reference data.

0     Purging References to Obselete Assemblies
+     Purging References to Obselete Assemblies
0     Sometimes it  is desirable  to purge  from the  accumulated cross-referenc
      references to assemblies that that, for one reason or another,  have becom
      obselete and have been dropped.   This might  also be necessary if the nam
      on the TITLE card for an assembly  has been changed thus making what reall
      is the same assembly module appear to  XREFOUT to be two different assembl
      modules.   To accomplish this purging, the user should place into the accu
      mulation file one or more "purge control records".   These are records tha
      start with a blank character (at offset +0)  followed by an assembly modul
      name (at offset +1 for up to 8 characters).  The remaining 149 bytes of th
      purge control record are ignored.
0        When XREFOUT encounters a purge control record, it will then delete fro
      the accumulated  data all records containing  an assembly module  name tha
      matches the one given  by the purge record.   Note that  an assembly modul
      name that is entirely blank is valid.    This corresponds to the case wher

0        Purge control  records must be put  into an accumulation  file manually
      They may be placed anywhere in the file since XREFOUT always sorts the fil
      in a way that  moves them to the top.   Any number of  purge records may b
      put into the file, and redundant records do not hurt.
0        There are any number of methods of placing purge records into an accumu
      lation file.   They can be edited in assuming  that the file is not too bi
      for the editor being used.  They can be written in with IEBGENER.   Just b
      sure to use  DISP=MOD.   Or they can  be placed into a  separate file whic
      would then be concatenated via JCL to the accumulation file when XREFOUT i
      executed.   Be aware, though, that XREFOUT does not support "unlike concat
      enation",  thus  the file containing the  purge records must have  the sam
      attributes as the accumulation file.
